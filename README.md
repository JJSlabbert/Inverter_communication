# Inverter_communication
Repository for code, documents, protocols to communicate with Inverters and batteries. Most of the Github Inverter projects are fancy and complicated with influxDB and Grafana. I will try to scale it down and simplify things.
My Own Setup:
Sacolar MHP 5000/ SUNICON MHP 5000.
The Internal Electronics is Growatt 5000 SPF Inveter, bud with only one MPTT charger
